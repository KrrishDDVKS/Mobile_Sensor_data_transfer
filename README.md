<h1># Mobile_Sensor_data_transfer</h1>
<br>
The usage of sensors in mobile reduce the cost of the model as it doesn't require to buy each and individual model.
<br>
The Code is used to create dataset for Machine learning purpose to train the model with that dataset.
The Project consists of two codes one is the code for creation of app in mobile and acts as a server and another code is used to collect data from the mobile through wire less medium following udp protocol which is a client.
<br>
AS UDP protocol is used in this project more than one clients can access the data transfered by the server.
<br>
Even the working demo of the App is given in the format of mp4 video. The github doesn't show the Video so one should download the mp4 file to view it.
